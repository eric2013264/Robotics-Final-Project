Minimum success conditions and gist of the project: 
	- We want to have the TurtleBot going in a loop (or square) using vision and have a drone track and follow the TurtleBot above it. We should end up with two robots going in loops, the drone slightly behind the TurtleBot. We initially wanted to have the TurtleBot go to a marker and then land the drone on the TurtleBot but we decided to be more realistic after hearing how difficult the drones can be to work with. At the minimum we want the drone to at least be in the air and able to see the TurtleBot. We don't yet know if we can actually get the drone to follow the TurtleBot. 

How will we meet these conditions:
	Timeline:
	11/20-11/30 Since we already have code for making the TurtleBot visually go in a square we will use this time to research what drones we have access to, what it is capable of doing, and how we can attain that tracking functionality we need. We will work with the TAs to accomplish this.
	12/1 Lab 5 is on drones! We'll (hopefully) learn a lot about drone localization from this lab.
	12/1-12/8 Work on the drone part of the final project
	12/9-12/11 Record the demo for extra credit and in case the live demo doesn't work
	12/11 Final presentations

What modules are needed:
	- For the turtleBot portion we already know what modules and libraries we will need from doing Lab 4.
	- We will need to research what modules the drone needs to see color, and then go toward it up to a certian point. Essentially what the TurtleBot did in that that vision guided square lab but the drone as well.
